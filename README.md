# CodeQuiz

At the point when I click the start button, a timer starts shown a question. At the point when I answer the question, then  I'm given the opportunity to answer another question. If i answer any of the question wrong, then time is deducted from the timer.
At the point when all questions are responded to or the timer arrives at 0, then the game is finished and you are presented with your score and a section to submit your initials.
